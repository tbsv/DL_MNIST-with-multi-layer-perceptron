# Deep Learning // MNIST with multi layer perceptron

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tbsv/DL_MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron/master?filepath=MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron_solution.ipynb)

This is Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

## Summary

In this lesson, we will create a multi-layer perceptron model and try to classify handwritten numbers. This is a very common entry-level problem for Tensorflow.

## Contents

There is 1 notebook in this repository:

- [MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron_solution.ipynb](MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron_solution.ipynb) : runs a MNIST with multi layer perceptron exercise that is taken from a Udemy course (see details in the *About* section below).

In addition, the following ressources are in this repository:

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) : lists all Python libraries that the notebook depends on.
- [DATA](DATA) : contains all data sets and further ressources that are used within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

Dependencies are specified in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can access this repo via **Binder** at the following URL 
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tbsv/DL_MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron/master or via the Binder badge above.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook locally. Therefore, you will need to have python installed,
preferably through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

## Run the notebook

Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `Cell` -> `Run All` in the toolbar.

For more information on running Jupyter notebooks, see the [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Documentation

In the following documentation section, you can see the results, reproduce them in the notebook and compare them with the expected output.

## Issues

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/tbsv/DL_MNIST-with-multi-layer-perceptron/issues) if you encounter any problems while trying to run the notebooks.

## About
This data science exercise is part of the Digital Business Engineering Master at HHZ.

The given examples were taken from the Udemy course [Python for Data Science, Machine Learning & Visualization](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning/).
